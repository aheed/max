Collision bullet/prefab
Collision specific per tile type?

Alternative approach: Game objects for interaction, tiles only for decoration (grass, water, road).
Note that some commonly occuring game objects (flack guns) should be active (shoot flack).

How to paint gameobjects on a grid? Gameobject brush?

To make shadow reusable: flip dependency around?
  Yes, because gameObjects can be destroyed anytime (!).

Implement SceneController*
  Function for constructing Max plane, enemy plane. Includes attaching prop and shadow.
  Set up max on startup

The object that got hit shall check altitude for actual hit and handle the consequences.*
  Report to the colliding thing (bullet or whatever)(?)
  Kill the colliding bullet?
  Every object dealing with it's own collision detection? => Double detection on each collision.*
  Helper class with static functions for altitude overlap check.*

Implement animations
  propeller

Change appearance of plane and shadow depending on if it's turning left/right.

Change appearance based on state. Shot enemy airplane.
