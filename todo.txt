Collision bullet/prefab
Collision specific per tile type?

Alternative approach: Game objects for interaction, tiles only for decoration (grass, water, road).
Note that some commonly occuring game objects (flack guns) should be active (shoot flack).

How to paint gameobjects on a grid? Gameobject brush?

To make shadow reusable: flip dependency around?
  Yes, because gameObjects can be destroyed anytime (!).
  Simplest is probably to make the shadow a child object (nested prefab).

Implement SceneController*
  Function for constructing Max plane, enemy plane. Includes attaching prop and shadow.
  Set up max on startup

The object that got hit shall check altitude for actual hit and handle the consequences.*
  Report to the colliding thing (bullet or whatever)(?)
  Kill the colliding bullet?
  Every object dealing with it's own collision detection? => Double detection on each collision.*
  Helper class with static functions for altitude overlap check.*

Implement animations
  propeller*

Change appearance of plane and shadow depending on if it's turning left/right.*

Change appearance based on state. Shot enemy airplane.

How to set draw order based altitude? (max vs enemy plane on top)*
  Set draw order dynamically based on altitude

Shot plane:
  Burnt unicolor shape (not same as crashed max)
    fades in 4 shades of gray from white to black
  Flack explosion under it at the same time

Bombs
  Dropping*
  Effect on collision.
  Should not collide with anything until it's on ground level (z close to 0).*

Houses  

Use parent/child object relationships instead of home made solutions for relative position. 
Use transform.localposition instead of a separate offset vector.
  Max vs refobj*
  Bomb vs refobj*
  Shadow vs plane*
  Get rid of IPositionObservable.GetPosition()
    IPositionObservable should be renamed/split?

Use GetComponent to get scene position reference object instead of passing it through the hierarchy.

Make river sections as quads 
  https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Example-CreatingaBillboardPlane.html
  3 distinct slopes
  random height of each quad (sections with same slope)
  When approaching landing:
    Select the closest side of the river to land.
    The slope going the other way can not occur anymore at that point => inevitable drift to the correct side.
    Landing strip shows up when the river is out of the picture.
      Stack the odds even more in favor of bending river the preferred direction.
    Similar on start until river shows up.
    One mesh per gameobject.
    The river of a level could be a gameobject with a single mesh.
      x sections with restrictions to get close to the river.
      y sections without slope restrictions
      z sections with restrictions to get away from the river
    Correct river material to get the right color and rendering over background according to z coordinate.*
    Original game: Bridges need a long stretch of neutral slope river. Unless it's approaching landing in which case another slope makes the river bank look incorrect (!) at bridge end.

Landing strip gameObject at start and end of river section.

Color change temporarily on explosion (river and ground):
  https://discussions.unity.com/t/change-color-and-glow-for-a-while/924415/5
  Might be trickier for sprites

Temporary color swap at detonation:

  post processing for 2D game??

Min distance river -> house, tank...
No houses, flack or tanks beside landing strip
  Houses are never side by side in the Original game
Extra tanks around houses
River should be farther away from landing strip. No overlapping or near.
Flight restrictions*
  should match camera view size
MaxControl: refObject member not necessary. Only used to set parent object for bombs. Could be done by getting maxcontrol's own parent object.

Easiest: let SceneController keep track of everything
  refobj position vs end of level*
  Plane status
    accelerating
    decelerating
    flying as normal
    collided w enemy plane
    out of fuel
    killed by flack
    refuelling/repairing
  SceneController controls the status, MaxControl acts accordingly when status changes and also reacts to input based on status.
  
IGameEventReporter, implemented by SceneController
  Info flow:
    Any active object -> gameEventReporter -> refobj, max, ...
To decouple: new gameobject with sole purpose to delegate implementation of IGameEventReporter (to SceneController).
  A single static instance: GameState
    Allows game events to be reported and echoed to any registered observer.
    Also allows stats and info, like airplane speed, to be read.

Keep all game objects under a parent object (Level). Swap out levels as needed.*
  Some things, like enemy planes, can be without parent level object.

---
River veers off to the right. Adjust probabilities.*

Landing:*
  Low altitude, plane over runway.
    Super simple implementation: y coordinate of plane is within y coordinates of the runway.
     and abs(refobject.x - plane.x) < half runway width

To do:
Disable/destroy out-of-range flack guns*
Keep all objects out of range deactivated. Reactivate when getting in range.*
  Big square collider, viewport size?
    It should be possible for a disabled game object to collide, as long as its collider is not disabled.
  Better than a collider: keep one collection of game objects per row
    => Easy to detect when a new row is in range or out of range. Objects and their colliders can be turned off when out of range.
       Objects going out of range can be immediately destroyed.
     This is also a good way to trigger cars driving on the roads just as the plane passes.
Restrict response to user input based on game status.*
Make enemy planes move at speeds proportional to max speed.
Disable prop on DEAD or KILLED_BY_FLACK.*
Disable shadow on DEAD.*
  Prop and shadow can implement IGameStateObserver to achieve this in a decoupled way.*
Change/split the ACCELERATING state to more resemble FLYING when the plane has reached takeoff speed but is still accelerating.*
Restart the game (after cooldown period to avoid accidental restart. New state?)*
Create GameState instance dynamically (otherwise problems on switching scenes?)
Dash board with UI toolkit*
Sustain damage on flack hit*
Repair damage*
Debug repair input action*
Implement M damage*
Implement B damage*
Implement G damage*
Remove OUT_OF_FUEL state?
bug: no shadows shown for enemy planes in DEAD state*
Enemy aircraft*
Collided state*
Format Dashboard
Set/blink dashboard background color based on state*
Tree/house collisions*
Bomb effect*
  ground*
  river*
  trees (none)*
  tanks*
  flack guns*
  roads*
  house*
Gun effect on ground objects*
  flack guns*
  tanks*
  boats*
Bridges*
Cars*
Make the plane move relative the camera with diagonal movement*
  altitude + relativeY <= maxAltitude*
  (Does not drop altitude if down + left and min offset) Not a bug*
  Y offset shall drift slowly to 0 if not actively controlled by user input*
  Y offset shall also mean corresponding x offset when decreasing*
Make it possible to destroy enemyplane game objects without causing dangling pointer problems.*
  Unregister prop as listener on destruction?*
Alerts
Bug: IsOverLandingStrip seems to be a half landing strip width off.*
(Divide colliders into layers in a smart way)
Change box collider into polygon colliders?
Make it possible to fire gun in collided state*
Boats*
  type1*
  type2*
Tank and FlackGun and level  2 cars should share code (inheritance? exactly the same script?).
Bug: sometimes collision with invisible enemy planes. Inactive ones from previous level?
Make all ground/water objects uniform height, a configurable safe height.*
Change airplane colliders from box to polygon
Correct spelling flack->flak
Head-on enemy planes

----------
Do we need this?
public enum GameEvent
{
    START,
    RESTART_REQUESTED
}

void OnGameEvent(GameEvent gameEvent);
--------

Bridge:*
  Split into 2 sprites. Only the middle one shall have z value possible to fly under.
  One bridge top collider. Possible to go over or under.
  The pylons could be a single polygon collider with 2 paths.
  Need for a bridge script at all?
    Yes, we still need it to implement IPositionObservable
  How to make cars and mushroom clouds appear on top of bridges?
  Bridge midsection must be sorted in same (or higher) layer as Max (aircraft) to appear above it.
  In fact cars, vip targets etc on bridges must also appear over Max when Max goes under a bridge.
    Kill airplane layer?*
    Switch to ground layer when under a bridge?
  Possible improvement: cars could change its sorting order when entering/leaving bridge to avoid appearing under a low passing plane.


works:
docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 --name web -v /home/anders/Documents/github/max/webbuild:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

works better (no caching):

Why is it not possible to hit boat2 with bombs??*
  Seems IsTrigger must be checked

Todo:
(Cars arrive too late. Change level width or car timing.)
Boats should collide with other boats? And bridges? Would be fun.
Sunk animation for boat1.*
Vip animations for enemy planes, cars*
Targets (vip bridges and houses)*
Blue dash color when enemy plane is on sameish altitude*
Go to state FINISHED when landing after all enemy HQs bombed*
Blink green dash before landing to finish game
  Fireworks or some visual clue the game is completed successfully
Shadows should have animated prop (?)


-----
Generic house:
  Make the box collider a polygon collider with 6 points and set calc each point at resize.*
  Remove target on bomb hit*
  Set the color to white before activating flipbook*
  Implement SetColor*
  Set altitude and height for collisions according to size (height)
  Prevent houses from being close to each other.*
  Make a black house variation with green windows

Bridge: remove target on bomb hit*
River should have a black line at its left bank.*


Enemy air strips
  reuse code for drawing friendly landing strip?
  Add parked plane sprites on top.
  Set polygon collider (4 pts) in code.*
  bombable hangar (to be used for friendly hangars too? Negative score? :))
  Fixed x offset from parallel road*
  Loop to populate before houses etc.*
  Should have double end markings, not single ones as friendly landing strips.*

Bugs
Enemy vip planes are yellow??*
destroyed flak guns keep firing?*
Everything is tilted slightly to the left??*
  Straight road is not vertical on screen. Columns of objects are not straight.*
  Caused by non-square cells and mixing visual slope with logical river/road slopes.
    To do (?): support non-square cells
Tree2 does not collide with anything*
Props get destroyed and never removed from game observer collection.*
  Implement UnregisterObserver*
Bullet does not stop on flack gun collision. Stops on tanks though.*
Sometimes ground targets (tanks..) can not be hit even though the dash is brown*
Shadow of oncoming enemy plane is backward. Will anyone notice?
Boat2 can go over road at right side of a bridge.
  Add extra bridge child/collider specifically to solve this?


------
After completing the game (bomb all 3 enemy HQs and land):
  Fly into a 3D level
  Whoa! What's happening? Where am I?
  You appear to have entered the 21st century.
  Oh. Do people still play video games?
  They sure do.
  The games are better?
  Well... more advanced.
  Is it still OK to simulate warfare for entertainment?
  Sure. As long as there is no nudity or non-inclusive language.
  Eh...what??
  Just go bomb the **** out of some enemies, Max.
  Aye sir!
